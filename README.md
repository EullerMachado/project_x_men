## General-info

In this repository, I enthusiastically present my collaborative work on the "Dev em Dobro" channel project. Here, I had the opportunity to enhance my web development skills using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, while diving into the fascinating X-Men universe.

The project focuses on an interactive and responsive interface, designed for all fans of the X-Men animated series. Through it, users have the possibility to explore and select different characters, providing an immersive experience filled with information about these iconic heroes and villains.

Creating this interface brought about various exciting challenges. I aimed to ensure that the user experience was intuitive, allowing X-Men fans to easily find the characters they wanted to learn more about. At the same time, responsiveness was carefully implemented, ensuring the interface adapts seamlessly to mobile devices, tablets, and computers without losing the essence of the visual narrative.

In summary, this repository represents a journey of learning and creativity, where I combined my web development skills with my passion for the X-Men. I hope that this interface inspires and delights all fans of this beloved animated series.
## Technologies

- HTML: Is the fundamental foundation for building interactive and structured web pages.

- CSS: The styling was implemented using CSS, giving life and personality to the project. Colors and styles were applied that refer to the universe of God of War Ragnarok, creating an immersive atmosphere for users.

- JAVASCRIPT: The interactivity and dynamism of the page were achieved with programming in Javascript. Through Javascript, it was possible to add features such as character selection, display of different information for each selected character.
